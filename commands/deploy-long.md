The `ng deploy` command is a shortcut for:

```
ng run [PROJECT_NAME]:deploy
```

It takes an optional project name, as specified in the `projects` section of the `angular.json` workspace configuration file.

When a project name is not supplied, the CLI will execute the `deploy` builder for the default project.
