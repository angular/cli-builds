/**
 * Escapes a search query for FTS5 by tokenizing and quoting terms.
 *
 * This function processes a raw search string and prepares it for an FTS5 full-text search.
 * It correctly handles quoted phrases, logical operators (AND, OR, NOT), parentheses,
 * and prefix searches (ending with an asterisk), ensuring that individual search
 * terms are properly quoted to be treated as literals by the search engine.
 * This is primarily intended to avoid unintentional usage of FTS5 query syntax by consumers.
 *
 * @param query The raw search query string.
 * @returns A sanitized query string suitable for FTS5.
